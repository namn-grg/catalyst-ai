## Description
Catalyst is a revolutionary AI tool that has been developed using Pinecone and OpenAI. Its main feature is the ability to allow users to input their notion database and get instant information by modelling it using OpenAI.

This tool also has the capability of extracting data from **github repos** and **documentation websites** (made using Gitbook). 

This means that users can easily access all the relevant data they need without having to manually search for it.
