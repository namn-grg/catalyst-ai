# xNFT Backpack on Solana

**Open Questions**

- [ ]  Is XNFT like iframe standard for the backpack wallet?

**What is Anchor?**

Designed on top of Rust, **Anchor allows you to build programs quickly** reducing the engineering work and **providing various boilerplates for your Solana program.**

Plus, Anchor’s boilerplates have been thoroughly tested and audited, making them very reliable.

**What is Backpack and xNFT?**

Coral is set to launch its own wallet product named Backpack. This aims to utilize so-called xNFTs which act as applications that allow users to access decentralized apps and assets across different blockchains within the wallet UI in one place through the uptake of its "xNFT" developer framework. We’re building not a wallet, but something different, an xNFT operating system we call **Backpack on top of xNFT framework.**

xNFT is an open, programmable system built for Web3. And like any other application operating system, has a set of developer frameworks and APIs associated with it, allowing anyone to build their own xNFT apps for any protocol on any blockchain—without permission as a native app within their wallet. 

xNFTs (short for “executable NFTs”) are react-native decentralized apps that run natively within the Backpack Wallet. xNFTs work by binding a javascript or index.html bundle to an NFT in the [xnft.gg](http://test.xnft.gg/) publishing flow. That executable code is then rendered in Backpack when users click on that application. 

Entire protocols or specific features can be built as xNFTs, depending on each projects desired use-case within a wallet. xNFT builders can leverage Backpack’s RPCs, notifications, messaging, usernames and fiat onramps to avoid having to find 3rd party providers or building complex functionality in-house. 

In many ways, React xNFT is just React. You have everything you're used to like JSX, hooks, functional components, and browser APIs.The major difference is that apps run inside an isolated browser sandbox without access to the DOM. Whenever you want to render something, you need to use the components provided by `react-xnft`
, which will handle all communication with the host environment to safely render components, giving developers the ability to build decentralized UIs with a native look and feel.

**Traction**

Under the private beta of Backpack, NFT marketplace Magic Eden, blockchain gaming projects DefiLand and Aurory, and trading app Mango Markets are set to debut as xNFT applications.

There are currently 50+ xNFTs live at [xNFT.gg](http://test.xnft.gg/), including everything from token staking to NFT marketplaces to games to NFT borrow/lend protocols. 

**Use-Cases/Benefits**

1. XNFT backpack Sol and Eth in the SAME wallet!! protected from phishing attacks! Not only is this more secure than the standard flow (by having verified apps actually held in one’s wallet), but overall makes the UX much cleaner.
2. xNFTs aim to act as applications within Backpack, allowing users to engage assets from tokens to decentralized applications, fiat onboarding and NFTs across different blockchains and protocols.
3. xNFTs make the crypto experience smoother, require fewer steps and give projects the power to create more customized experiences for their communities.
