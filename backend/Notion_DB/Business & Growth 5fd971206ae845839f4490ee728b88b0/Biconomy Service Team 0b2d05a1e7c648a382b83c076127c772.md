# Biconomy Service Team

General outline for service tiers and custom integration support. 

## Journey

Growth speaks with partner leads and determines a custom buildout is necessary to move forward. Or, the partner lead is interested in service level agreement support. Growth huddles with product/engineering to discuss the requirements and form a strategy. Devrel could lead the strategy development.  

## What is a Service Team?

The dedicated Service team that provides technical development support + relationship management. Ensures the partnerâ€™s tech is online and working. Troubleshoot bugs and edge cases, etc. Spends dedicated time architecting new solutions with partners, including gathering requirements and planning internal development of new features. 

- Technical Partner Management
- Partner Success
- Dev Rel

## Why do we need a Service Team?

If we need to do custom work, we would need to clone Chiragâ€¦.how much will that cost us?  We care because we donâ€™t want to lose money for doing that custom work (extra chirag)â€¦.this pricing is not included in our flat % transaction premium.  Weâ€™re trying to account for this service (premium). 

The primary goal is to not lose money. Risks:

- chirag spends too much time servicing partners when he could be building on the roadmap (i.e., opportunity cost)
- We are forced to hire another chirag to do custom integrations/service support and we donâ€™t charge for it

Secondary goals:

- lock clients in subscription agreements that generate revenue (ie. Enterprise model and service expectations)
- Enables net new use cases (generates future premium income)

Third order affect:

- Allows us to keep tx premiums low
- Only dApps that need access to the Service Team pay. Note, the alternative here is increasing tx premiums for all dApps.

## Where does the Service Team fit in the org structure?

Devrel? 

## Resource Needs

- Bulletproof docs (allows us to scale properly)
- Devrel for pre-integration
- Partner Success (i.e., Account Management) for post-integration
- Support desk (technology & humans)
    - Note, this is referred to as a Technical Partner Manager (i.e., 24x7 tech support team). May be fulfilled by our devrels to begin.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ We donâ€™t likely need a Technical Partner Manager to start. Ideal end state.

### Outstanding Pricing Questions

- Would we be leaving money on the table by posting subscription rates on the website?

    - Should we show the subscription packages available on the website, but not post pricing?
