### Channels for reach-out

1. Telegram
2. Discord
3. Twitter
4. Forum (Discourse)
5. Reddit (very less likely)

### Process for Outbound

1. Find a project who has some basic traction and users.
2. Find where to reach out? -  Telegram/Discord
3. Find who to reach out ? - POC (can be one or multiple), reach out to atleast 2 POC’s
4. Understand what the project is doing and how do we fit in. Figure out what to pitch? (use case specific + always include a case study or an example)
5. If the person responds and books a call, we’re good else plan, the next steps? (track and follow up, if no response after 3 follow ups then drop)
    1. While follow ups, With every subsequent follow up you can share an additional benefit or case study to help the lead more and not sound salesy/monotonous.
    2. Try changing POC’s and channels to maximise the chances of a win. 
6. Track overall metrics to track

### Components of an effective pitch

1. introduction
2. value addition/use case/what we will do for them
3. live demo and/or data metrics/case study
4. next steps

### Learnings till now

1. Sending the lead links/articles before their engagement seems to not work and throws them off. (Sometimes less is more)
2. Making the “pitch” seem like a potential collab/partnership makes it more likely for the lead to get on a call than making it seem like we have a product to sell to them.
3. Mentioning the specific use cases/dropping relevant case studies related to their sphere does wonders.
4. Getting better response rates on TG after buying Telegram premium and the “blue star” that comes with it.
5. Follow-ups are very important, especially with leads that engaged/replied.
6. Reach out to multiple POCs preferably over multiple channels for a project.
7. Choose POCs that are a part of the core team rather than non-decision makers (eg. CEO, CMO, CTO rather than a CM)
