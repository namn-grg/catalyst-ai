# Data Dashboard

### New integrations in a timeframe

Need a list of dapps that have made their FIRST mainnet transaction within the given time-period. User should be able to change the time period from a dropdown on the front-end level and then run the query.

- query exists on sales dashboard for 30 days, combine to one table for all chains
- update the excel sheet with FIRST txn in Q2 (can be registered anytime)

### Active DApps in a timeframe

Dapps that have done a mainnet transaction in a given timeframe. Not necessarily the first transaction.

- query exists but separately which is fine
- sheet data also exists

### Dev signups in a timeframe.

See the Total dev signups in a given timeframe. I need to see the rows on a daily basis in that specified timeframe. If possible give a dropdown to switch to a monthly basis.

- query exists on sales dash

### DApp registrations but yet to do a main-net transaction in a timeframe

With this there is no need to track simple registrations, since the one who go live will be captured in active dapps above and others here.

- query exists
- sheet data also exists

### Gas Tank deposits in a timeframe

is the gas table same so that we can populate this in the same query instead of a separate one?

- send link for query will add to dashboard

### Find out inactive Dapps (churn)

Any dapp who has not made any transaction in last 30 days but was active in last 90 days.

- query link to be shared

### Dapp Name - Dapp ID Master Search

### Per Dapp by Dapp ID -

Dollar Volume in a timeframe

Unique Users in a timeframe -  we can fetch on a monthly level

public gas dash - might not be new
