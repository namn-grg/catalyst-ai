# Sales Pitch/Call Template

1. Starting with a question allows you to better understand the prospect's needs while engaging them in the pitch.
2. Ask questions like the most significant pain points they have, especially with customer onboarding and retention or with transaction flow? Are they facing any issues with reoccurring gas payments?

## 4. Sell **benefits of the product along with why Biconomy is the best provider**

1. Understand the customer's problems/use case and try to provide them value accordingly. Sell benefits, not features.
