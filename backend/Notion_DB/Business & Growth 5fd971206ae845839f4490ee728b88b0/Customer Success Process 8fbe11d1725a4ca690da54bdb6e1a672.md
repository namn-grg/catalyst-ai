# Customer Success Process

We want to enable a culture where we are super driven by customer feedback and are able to provide world-class services to our customer whenever is it needed.

## Service

1. Take extra care of top accounts (by transaction volume and revenue)
    1. Daily sweep the channels with these accounts to see if there’s something that can be done
    2. Keep turnaround time to less than 24hours for these
2. For all other customers not on this list, do a biweekly sweep, to check if there are any unread messages or errors that are stuck and take the relevant actions.
    1. Keep turnaround time for these to be maximum 2 weeks.
3. The above two pointers should cover all active leads. Now for the leads that are inactive, we can use bots (Telegram/Email) to keep a monthly check-in and send out a generic message just to warm these folks us.

## Feedback

1. Get on quarterly feedback interviews with all top accounts (by transaction volume and revenue)
2. For all other’s (inactive or active), send out quarterly feedback collection messages and survey’s (maybe with attached incentives) to gather adhoc opinions
