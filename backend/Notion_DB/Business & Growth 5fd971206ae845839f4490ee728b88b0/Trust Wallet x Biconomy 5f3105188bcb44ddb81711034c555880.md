## Products and Services for Trust Wallet

Our SDK simplifies interactions with any blockchain and offers several advantages, including social sign-in, fiat on-ramps and checkouts, gas-less transactions, transaction batching, cross-chain transfers, and more. Integrating the Biconomy SDK will simplify the transaction process for Trust Wallet users and enhance their overall experience.

In addition, we offer the following services:

1. **Token Paymaster**: The Token Paymaster service provides Smart Contract Wallet (SCW) users with the flexibility to pay transaction fees in any token. Our Paymaster handles all gas fees and ensures that transactions reach their intended destinations. This service will further simplify the transaction process for Trust Wallet users.
2. **24/7 Support**: Our team is available around the clock to assist with any issues, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted service. Trust Wallet users can rely on us for quick and effective solutions to any problems.
3. **Developer Dashboard**: Developers can monitor and manage all aspects of their EIP-4337 integration, including operations, paymasters, and bundlers, all from a single, intuitive interface. The dashboard also includes comprehensive documentation and practical code samples to aid in the integration process. This feature will make it easier for developers to integrate our services into Trust Wallet.

## **Pricing Structure**

We offer a pricing structure that balances user convenience and financial viability. Here's a more detailed overview:

1. **Collection and Conversion**: We will collect the top 10 BEP20 tokens on BSC Chain and automatically convert them into BNB at the end of each 6-hour period (epoch). This ensures that users can easily pay transaction fees in their preferred tokens.
2. **Base Premium**: A base premium of 10% will be levied on each of the 10 supported tokens to cover operational expenses. This fee is reasonable and helps us cover our costs.
3. **Variance Fee**: The median daily variance for each token will be calculated and added as a fee to safeguard against token price volatility. This fee ensures that we can mitigate the risks associated with token price fluctuations.
4. **Slippages and Costs**: Any swapping slippages and related costs incurred during transactions will be absorbed by us. 
5. **New token support:** We are open to adding paymaster support for additional BEP20 tokens as needed. If requested, we will share the fee premium for the respective tokens.
