CRM SOP

- Excel

Red highlights = No Telegram/Invalid Telegram (Reach out via email ***if worth***)

Green highlights = Reached out on Telegram once

Darker Green highlights = Reached out a 2nd time (Transfer these to Notion CRM, and check on Growth calls if telegram groups have been created & CRM if account is there)

- Telegram groups will be created after calls
