## **Downsides for AA wrt to Gamers**

Account abstraction sounds great! But there are some downsides to also consider:

- **Signing issues**: Ideally, all apps would follow [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) to validate signatures (legacy apps like Opensea, there is no clarity). Unfortunately, this is not always the case and those apps would be incompatible with contract accounts.
- **Higher gas cost**: On L2s and other scaling solutions this becomes less of a problem. However, more research on how to reduce gas costs in this context, especially on the Ethereum main net, is required.

### Focus on dev-ex for the diffrenciation.

Need option to chosse b/w AA and EOA flow. Need native SDK for Mobile. More tutorials/better monitoring/more sample code examples

Guilds as they existed before no longer need to exist, but we’re curious about how (and how well) the largest guilds will try to adapt in the new year.

P2E models have died, DAUs are at all time lows, the main problem with every game is 

How to hook users to the game?

How to create healthy economies within the game? Player should extract less value than she provides for the model to run. 

game economies must be designed for net-inflows

rewards are ideally reserved for those who create outsized value for the ecosystem

Axie, Sorare, STEPN, Sandbox/Decentraland, STEPN, Pegaxy, Townstar, Defi Kingdoms, Crabada

some potential solutions:

limit transferability of consumable items in early game stages, after a certain point resources tied to that account can be claimed on-chain

set expectation early that assets wont generate ROI indefinitely

37/ limit the in game economic relevance or lifespan of in game assets

this can be in the form of a battle pass system or seasonal economy resets as seen in games like Diablo 2, Path of Exile and Escape from Tarkov, Fornite

web3 gaming is still very undeveloped with a lack of proper ecosystem publishers to support game makers and their projects. Web2 have studios that use publishers and publishers also develop their own games. In web3 there are content studios building stuff but the publisher part is missing. However, though the publisher model looks great on paper, it often requires a larger chunk of kick-starting capital and the expertise to take care of distribution channels and marketing as well as part of community management. Web2 publishers include Roblox, Valve

Examples: Animoca $470M, Fenix Games $150M, Mythical games $225M, Voodoo, Carry1st

these publishers are not limiting themselves to servicing web3 only products

Cheaper chains

ImmutableX: having gas free minting, trading and high txn speeds allowed to attract high quality titles such as Gods Unchained, Illuvium and 50 other games with 1000+ in testing

Polygon crashed seen in launch of on-chain game Sunflower Land

Arbitrum - home to the

[@Treasure_DAO](https://twitter.com/Treasure_DAO)

ecosystem

Nova - gaming and social focused L2 to improve network scalability

App specific chains: Polygon supernets, Avalanche subnets (DefiKingdoms, Crabada, Shrapnel)

this flexibility is attuned for gaming and allows teams greater control of the users experience without having to build from zero

Polygon supernets, Avalanche subnets (DefiKingdoms, Crabada, Shrapnel)

web3 gaming is not still mass market, most gamers out there are still web2, need solid distribution from web2 game publishers.

Most common motivation for the gamer is still the incentives of token or NFT.

Adding competitiveness to earn rewards add fun, adding unique profile avatars add fun, adding collectibles add fun to the game.
Mobile > PC> Console, 85% gamers access from Mobile

US residents more likely to spend in game. - game play currency, level ups like potions, boosts, and inally cosmetics like skins, weapons

Fully inchain gaming - make all desicinsons on chain

Let’s take a look at [Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/)
, an RTS game that ran fully on-chain with zkSnark implemented. Players are able to explore the universe using hash power, capture planets, search locations, and trade this information anonymously (using ZK technology!). Developers are empowered to customize, fork, and otherwise mod the gameplay experience with plugins, third-party clients, smart contract extensions, and more. The game is certainly interesting and demonstrates the capability of information incomplete games to be built on-chain, but it is still constrained by the throughput of Ethereum and the state update requirement for each block.

Furthermore, if there are any loop-holes in the initial base rules design of the game, they would likely be exploited as more plug-ins and MODs emerge (e.g. a loophole to resource planets faster and hence break the balance of the game)

Furthermore, with on-chain gaming, a lot of changes to the game could be proposed, should they affect the balance of the game, having a backstop to limit them in case they break the game is also crucial, and to prevent whales from monopolizing and ultimately change the game is also a challenge

We will also see multi-rule sets/playable modes of the same game emerge(e.g. [Delysium](https://www.delysium.com/)
 Multiverse), giving players freedom of choice to participate in any of them. These parallel universes could also be designed to feed back (perhaps financially too, such as the one in Delysium) to the main universe creating even more interesting dynamics

I reckon the key for founders to build an interoperable game is not only to be able to **spot what’s possible to compose with the game mechanics/assets**
, but also to **be open and flexible in terms of stack designs**
, the more LEGO-like each layer of the stack. Other exciting parts about interoperable gaming that I could think of mostly revolve around the immigration of assets cross-games, imagine having your favorite Mario Kart character appearing seamlessly into Sandbox, or even more, bringing your entire circuit race to Sandbox and race on other players’ tiles! The barriers here though are again likely to be [business barriers](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/nft-game-interoperability/)

Blockchain’s wallets enable one single truth of identity to be used across many different universes, which helps players to enforce their gamer identity on the blockchain rather than in just a single game. (you could immediately verify you are a skilled shooter even as you are just starting a new character in a new shooting game, because of your other accolades in other games on the same blockchain)

For gamers who prefer to have different identities in different universes, avatars and account abstraction could be quite promising solutions.

With avatars, if players want to look completely different in different games, they could choose fully customize their characters using (interoperable) NFTs.

If they prefer to have avatars resembling themselves, they could choose to have a single central avatar that could be varied as they enter different games (as seen below, powered by AIGC in Lensa), this helps to both satisfy players who want to be “related but not the same” in different worlds.

![Untitled](Notes%20for%20GamingxAA%20Research%20Q1%202023%2044e4af162ee647fda676a5b7218d811e/Untitled.png)

Now if the player wants to be seen differently as they play different games, they could choose to create a new account each time they enter a new game (e.g. [firewallet](https://devfolio.co/projects/firewallet-42f4)
, [banana wallet](https://devfolio.co/projects/banana-smart-wallet-efca)
) as long as their wallet enables [ERC-4337](https://medium.com/infinitism/erc-4337-account-abstraction-without-ethereum-protocol-changes-d75c9d94dc4a)
 standard. As such, they have the flexibility to begin fresh in different games, and they are also able to trade individual accounts (e.g. selling the WoW account without selling the League of legends account under the same wallet).

There are a select few building fully on-chain games: Dark Forest, Conquest, Topology, DeFi Kingdoms, and Cometh.

◦ While pushing developmental boundaries is essential, they do not currently recommend other game devs build a fully on-chain game.

Bot prevention is a top concern when it comes to economic design. Bots can cause uncontrollable inflation, so game devs are actively trying to incorporate randomness into their game to mitigate potential damage.

In theory if these models are able to work and sustain they can provide an incomparable level of assurance over the time, money, and energy players invest into these worlds

## **Some Web3 game-specific features**

1. In-game/dapp-specific wallets (may need dapp-specific interfaces here)
    1. embed a wallet into your game instead of relying on external wallets that require users to install a browser extension. With an embeddable wallet and intuitive signing process, you'll remove a big roadblock and create a better user experience.
    2. Our own web UI/widget to view assets (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) with metadata plus send, bridge and swap within the same UI.
    3. UI Kits for in-game wallets (Web UX or Widget)
    4. Game devs want customizable wallet interfaces and in-game marketplaces. ****
    The wallet and in-game marketplace should blend seamlessly. Ideally, the wallet should be “invisible” to the player, and the marketplace should match the theme and style of the game.
2. **Unity** & Unreal Engine SDK integration
    1. Chainsafe also created a Unity SDK and in-game Marketplace
        
        Out-of-the-box, web3.unity comes with Unity prefabs & tooling that will make building web3 games a little bit easier. These features include:
        
        - In-game NFT minting
        - Integrable live marketplace for NFTs minted in-game or from the [ChainSafe Gaming Marketplace](https://marketplace.chainsafe.io/) web UI
        - Voucher-based NFT minting implementation
        - WebGL & WebWallet builds for desktop, mobile (iOS or Android), and browser games
        - web3 & social logins
        - Sign & verify digital signatures
        - Multiple ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 token interactions
        - Installing is as simple as **dragging and dropping an SDK file directly into Unity**
        . At once, you will have **access to a suite of tools, prefabs, scenes, and scripts** 
        for integrating any gaming application with the Web 3.0 ecosystem.
        - 
        
        Native in-game web3 integration for popular game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine, is in dire need.
        
        ◦
        ◦
        A game engine that directly integrates with web3 infrastructure via easy-to-use SDKs is urgently needed; wallets are a crucial component.
        
        Game devs and players alike want to sign transactions natively in-game without using a browser. Existing UX for desktop and mobile games needs improvement.
        
        ![Untitled](Notes%20for%20GamingxAA%20Research%20Q1%202023%2044e4af162ee647fda676a5b7218d811e/Untitled%201.png)
        
3. Native Mobile SDK’s for iOS and Android
4. In-game fiat payments in stables and native tokens (forward flow)
    1. Pay gas fees with in-game assets (NFT version of forward) - [https://twitter.com/METAPIXEL/status/1623264364848623618](https://twitter.com/METAPIXEL/status/1623264364848623618?s=20)
    2. Integrated one-click flows are needed for onramp and offramp
    3. Many account management SDKs now offer third-party solutions, allowing players to easily fund their accounts using Moonpay, Stripe, or Wyre. While most ramping services still lack the seamless experience made possible by Apple Pay, it’s certainly a step in the right direction and prevents player churn at the “funding” stage.
    4. US gamers used coinbase, [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) and cash app for fiat to crypto and while users in Brazil and South Africa are using sites like Binance.
5. Whitelabel NFT Marketplace and support with Opensea and other legacy dapps
    1. gaming NFTs update their metadata frequently. OpenSea does not offer metadata updating through APIs. There is game data that cannot be represented by normal on-chain metadata. Gaming NFTs are not a priority for marketplaces as their average price is much lower than PFP NFT.

6. A UI or contract for the dapps to easily airdrop NFT/Tokens to their users

1. **White glove support:** 
Game developers prioritize the availability of reliable support. Game devs want to know they chose a team they can rely on if/when they run into issues. By outsourcing account management, they are outsourcing much of their player’s onboarding experience.
2. **Developer portal and Player Analytics Dashboards:** 
Service providers are striving to deliver the best developer experience. Solutions such as Stardust let developers manage their games from a single dashboard, providing insights on game data and player metrics such as items created and tokens traded. Nefta takes this one step further and aims to bundle its AD SDK alongside its account management services, giving developers deeper insights to engage and monetize their audience.
3. Session keys
    1. Can use MPC to offer session key type experience
    2. 1:2 or 1:3 multisig where relayer is the signer or the dapp has one key to sign with certain limits.
    3. For example, the on-chain game “[The Citadel](https://library.citadel.game/docsa)
    ” recently teased its experimental session keys and Proof of Play, creators of [Pirate Nation](https://docs.piratenation.game/learn/wallet-pop-up-free-and-gas-less-gameplay)
    , released their initial vertical slice with this functionality. So what does this look like in practice? Proof of Play creates a burner / secondary wallet for each user when they initially log in, this wallet is custodial and stored in a user’s browser storage. The burner wallet grants Proof of Play the right to pay for their user’s transactions. This means that assets are never transferred out of your secure wallet, and items earned in-game are automatically sent to your secure wallet.
4. Human readable signatures - example Sunflower Land
5. Transaction Batching
    1. Allow dapps to batch transactions on their level
    2. Allow user to design batches such as bulk NFT sale/purchase
    3. [Realms](https://scroll.bibliothecadao.xyz/technology/account-abstraction)
     uses bundled transactions to allow players to harvest multiple farms or build multiple buildings at once.
6. Social login for easy onboarding
    1. provide social and email login for easy and quick login/sign-up. 
    2. Your players won't have to remember a private key/seed phrase to play the game and can log in using their existing email or social accounts.
7. Recovery - 3 approaches
    1. The normal way 2/3 trusted devices
    2. Using Multi-party computation (inbuilt sessions)
    3. [Using Email based AUTH with DKIM](https://docs.wallet.unipass.id/docs/architecture/email-on-chain-verification)
8. Metaverse/Demo as a tool to onboard gamers, give them access to such services that make this  demo & experience. Partner with Glip/Indigg to give them games, add this as a part of our offering.
9. [NFT Inventory](https://aithority.com/technology/game7-and-moonstream-to-introduce-nft-inventory-revolutionizing-the-web3-gaming-experience/)  - Right now player achievements are associated with player’s wallets, and their NFT character’s value depends mainly on the game’s success and popularity with other players. NFT Inventory allows game designers to define in-game assets that are owned by the player’s NFT Character, not by the player’s wallet. The inventory can hold ERC-1155 (weapons, armors, potions), ERC-721 (unique badges, special titles, player class), and ERC-20(gold, xp, etc) tokens, all of which can be combined together using an on-chain crafting system through the use of “recipes” and tied to the character.
10. Gaming and generative AI
    1. Use DALLE API - To generate AI graphics/avatar or any other NFT’s based on player preferences and personas.
    2. Use ChatGPT API - To generate custom in-game content (prompts) based on gameplay or preferences
11. [Security features](https://www.alchemy.com/top/security-tools) - whitelisting contracts, avoiding of phishing attacks and interaction with bogus contracts
12. Offer Sign in with Biconomy at the wallet page.
13. **Delegate Access:**
 A “Delegate wallet**”** 
is a smart contract account tied to a user’s cold wallet. Players sign once and authorize the account to act on their behalf without the risk of losing precious NFTs. Solutions such as [Delegate.cash](https://delegate.cash/) 
are gaining significant usage from NFT collectors who want a safer way to interact with various smart contracts. It’s only a matter of time before this is adopted by game companies looking to protect players’ assets. Liquid delegates are a fairly new concept and wrap delegation rights into an NFT. Liquid delegates are being used in gaming today. For example, Bored Ape holders are using liquid delegates to rent or grant access to their sewer passes which are used to play the endless runner Dookie Dash.
    1. Attack vectors like the OpenSea [stale listings problem](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415742560403-What-is-an-inactive-listing-)
     are prevented.
14. Open up **indexer service** for the wallet. User want to access token and NFTs (ERC 20, 712, 1155) and metadata (NFT images).
15. Create easy web-hooks so that dapps can do easily analytics with our wallets and systems. With the web hook a dapp can listen to all related events on the chain.
16. Gas Optimisations
    1. Optimise by Gas Estimation
    2. Optimise by Batching
17. ***ERC-4907:***
 Since the NFT rental platforms have gained popularity in the digital world, the ERC-4907 standard, proposed by Double Protocol, quickly became one of the most important token standards through its innovative and surprisingly simple implementation.
18. • ***Physical Backed Tokens (PBT):*** This is an innovative open-sourced token standard tying a physical item to a digital token on the Ethereum blockchain introduced by Chiru Labs, the team behind Azuki, in October. PBT can be used for decentralized authentication of goods; Tracking ownership lineage of physical goods; Using physical products to create digital experiences. With PBT, holders now can build a collection that captures both the digital & physical, trade authenticated items, or participate in real-life quests.
19. • ***Soulbound Tokens (SBT):*** SBTs are non-transferrable digital identity tokens that can represent the qualifications, experience, and/or reputation of a person or entity. These tokens take an innovative step towards representing and publicly verifying an individual’s reputation, achievements, and skill level, which will have wide-ranging implications for web3 games, guilds, players, etc. While SBTs are still a new concept, developers are already building SBT products that could be ready to use potentially by the end of this year.
20. **The NFT rental standard: ERC-4907**

The NFT rental marketplace [Double Protocol](https://double.one/about) is credited for submitting the rentable NFT standard [“EIP-4907,”](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip4907-erc-721-user-and-expires-extension/8572) which passed final review by the Ethereum development team on June 28 and became the 30th ERC standard.

The ERC-4907 standard is an extension of ERC-721 that introduces the dual roles of ‘owner’ and ‘user’ at its application layer. ERC-4907 streamlines NFT rentals through an automated ‘expires’ function which enforces the time-limited role of the user. This innovative feature makes NFTs rentable by default; owners no longer have to manually withdraw user rights, eliminating a tedious process and another on-chain transaction.

## ****What do blockchain gamers look like?****

The most active region [currently](https://www.finder.com/nft-games-statistics) is SEA, followed by LATAM and Africa. In essence, blockchain games are more popular in developing countries than in developed countries, and the ARPU (average revenue per user) for blockchain gaming is much higher than traditional Web 2 games (e.g. Axie Infinity has >[$100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43tRtkIo98c) ARPU)

![Untitled](Notes%20for%20GamingxAA%20Research%20Q1%202023%2044e4af162ee647fda676a5b7218d811e/Untitled%202.png)

To sustain the economy, we need more value creators (those who spend) than extractors. (we dive deeper into the game economy under the Open Economy Challenges section. ) SEA, LATAM, and Africa [are not regions that are most actively spending in games](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/308454/gaming-revenue-countries)
, the US, China, Japan, South Korea, and the UK are.

*It is worth considering tailoring games in order to attract players from these 5 regions as they could be helpful to sustain the game economy. In that sense, the focus of blockchain gaming needs to shift towards being fun, and despite the similarities in US and UK markets, China, JP, and SK are 3 vastly different gaming markets (check out top downloaded games for [different regions](https://www.similarweb.com/zh/apps/top/apple/store-rank/jp/games/top-free/iphone/)) with different player behaviors and cultures, therefore regionalization could be an important tactic to be adopted, and **I am excited about teams who aim to target these regions with tailored marketing strategies**. For example, that would be to develop Anime themed ARPG for the Japanese market with a focus on Twitter and Line presence or to focus on mobile-based FPS games if the targeted region is India with a marketing strategy heavily focused on [Youtube influencer collaborations](https://www.lumikai.com/post/the-lumikai-latest-decoding-the-indian-gamer).*

Right now the most active DAU’s are CCGs (collectible card games) and strategy-based games. These have shorter dev cycles and are easy to fit in with NFT and Defi and cater to speculative audience. As the infra is better and dev cycles get shorter that could mean we see **ARPGs, Open Worlds, Hyper-casuals** etc.

Amongst a long list of advantages that blockchain provides to gaming:

1. transparency (most contents on-chain is visible to everybody)
2. ownership (your assets in your wallet is yours until the blockchain stops running)
3. interoperability (Like the case mentioned in Mario Kart)
4. decentralization (opens more doors for community developers to get involved)
5. self-sovereignty (the game runs as long as the blockchain runs)

## **Reasons for Gamers & Studios to adopt Web3**

1. New reward/incentive models for players, Play to earn is the entry point for consumers entering crypto
    1. X to Earn rewards
    2. Asset appreciation and liquidity via secondary sales
2. Asset ownership and identity, and ability to customise/upgrade assets on-chain
    1. you are bound to get the ownership of your assets even after the sale because it links them to players, not games.
    2. when a player buys an asset, the technology ties the asset to the player instead of the video game, protecting not only the financial resources of the players, but also the limited assets that they have on their accounts.
3. Transparency
    1. This particular facet of the Web3 gaming industry protects investments and ensures fair play in gaming environments where developers can’t easily take advantage or exploit users’ card information since all transactions are transparent with blockchain-based systems.
4. New revenue models for game creators/publishers
    1. players can put up personal funds on the marketplace if they decide to buy a particular item in order to sell it to fellow players within the game or outside it. The in-app purchases of the  games through in-game assets make over half of the gaming revenues.
5. Decoupling assets/gameplay from the game ecosystem
    1. Web3 games have been working in the same direction, enabling gamers to switch their digital assets easily in the form of NFTs- non fungible tokens which allow interactive communication between numerous games and sometimes, even outside applications.
6. Opportunity to be an early influencer
    1. Influencers have made their way into the hearts of the audience. If you didn’t know that a term called ‘Web3 gaming influencer’ existed, then you must add it to your dictionary now.
7. Ease of modification
    1. Modifying games on Web 2.0 was a Herculean task as their creators always seemed to be reluctant to do so. Enters Web 3.0 — it encourages an open space and freedom when it comes to modifying the game. It allows gamers to introduce changes in the game to fit their needs.
    

## Types of games

When we talk about gaming, there are a few different types of games that may be helpful to explain:

1. Free to play
    1. *Overall, F2O seems more suitable for well-funded studios with a plan to implement gatcha system as well as a clear monetization plan towards traditional fat tail players, but the idea is quickly revolving and more suitable use cases could emerge soon.*
    2. **Free to Play** games entice players with no-cost entry, and then monetize through in-game upgrades, advertisements, and/or purchases. These games, such as Runescape and Fortnite, have wielded some of the most engaged and passionate communities of gamers ever witnessed online.
        
        ‍
        
        ## Principles of Free to Own (F2O)
        
        There are two defining principles of F2O:
        
        1. **The community mints and owns the first NFTs for free.**
        2. **Those NFTs should be “factories” that generate other NFTs.**
        
        Let’s break down the benefits of this model below.
        
        Using free mints: strong user acquisition strategy, prevents the assets from be considered securities (additionally avoids apple 30% fee)
        
        free-to-own meta has helped NFT projects launch due to lower consumer market sentiment and expectations
        
    3. Free to play games as stated in the title are games that are free to play. Publishers and gaming studios will typically generate their revenue through premium features such as FIFA.
    4. Today, free to play games are the fastest growing games with many of these games being mobile first.
    5. How do game developers make money from free games? The
    answer is simple: microtransactions. Free-to-play games are
    synonymous with microtransaction-driven revenue models.
    While mobile games were the first to demonstrate the viability
    of microtransactions, game developers soon realized that freeto-play game economics were key to unlocking vast amounts of
    ongoing revenue. By removing the upfront cost, all friction to try
    out a game was gone. Game developers could cast a wider net in
    the hopes of catching a whale (consumers with disproportionately
    high lifetime values). Multiplayer-focused games, like Fortnite and
    Warzone, leverage microtransactions to give players the ability to
    earn cosmetic items for signaling status in-game. Mobile games,
    like Candy Crush, leveraged microtransactions to give players the
    opportunity to save time from key moments in-game.

2. Play to earn - play games and make an income
    1. You typically have to pay to start playing the game but the key difference is that you own your in-game assets as you play which can be traded, exchanged or stored on the blockchain. If the game producer (the creator of your favourite games) was to ever die, your assets are still available to be used across alternative games - you will simply be able to transfer them and use them in the next popular games.
3. ***Free-to-Own:*** F2O is the strategy coined by Limit Break gaming studio’s whereby the studio mints a genesis NFT collection (DigiDaigaku in the case of Limit Break) and gives them away for free in an exclusive and secretive fashion. F2O lays the foundation for a new type of gaming economy, which is being proposed as an improvement on both free-to-play mobile games and the play-to-earn models that sell their game NFTs to players upfront. Whether F2O is fair or not, this model is one of the most promising we’ve seen in web3 gaming in 2022.
4. Mobile vs desktop
    1. Historically, games have been more interactive on mobile as they are more accessible.
5. Cloud Gaming
    1. Netflix for gaming in simple words. You pay a subscription fee to access the hardware and content of the game
    2. Gaming Sandboxes/Clouds
        1. Hyperplay - DesktopUI
        2. TreasureDAO - WebUI (Arbitrum)
        3. [https://bullieverse.com/home](https://bullieverse.com/home) - WebUI (Polygon)
        4. Fractal (Polygon)
        5. Cartidge (Starknet)

## **Challenges for game developers**

![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 10.02.20 PM.png](Notes%20for%20GamingxAA%20Research%20Q1%202023%2044e4af162ee647fda676a5b7218d811e/Screen_Shot_2023-02-16_at_10.02.20_PM.png)

1. Chain selection on where to build the game - transaction fees, dev support, exisitng use base are most important factors
    1. 
        
        ![Untitled](Notes%20for%20GamingxAA%20Research%20Q1%202023%2044e4af162ee647fda676a5b7218d811e/Untitled%203.png)
        
    2. In traditional games, it is normal that multiple servers exist and the in-game economies remain separate between one another. However, the openness of blockchain creates new challenges for crypto game developers as they look to balance the interests of existing and new players and manage potential exploit risks inherent to cross-chain asset transfers.
    3. 
2. So in short, while Sequence's wallet has shortcomings regarding decentralisation, it's comparable to saying "I have 500€ on coinbase rather than on Ledger". It sounds to me like an acceptable deal for 90% of the population who do their first steps in web3. - From user interviews, decentralisation is not that important when the 1t step is complicated
3. Current ERC721 NFT standards are not well suited for the application of web3 games. ERC721’s non-fungible characteristics make it nearly impossible for there to be a trustless third-party minting interface. This makes it difficult for in-game use cases such as crafting (combining NFTs to generate a new NFT), burning (deleting NFTs), and other functionalities trustlessly onchain. Current NFT minting standards are not optimal for gaming. They force game devs to set a predefined supply cap for collections; it is difficult to predict demand beforehand.
    1. [https://docs.moonstream.to/terminus/](https://docs.moonstream.to/terminus/) - Terminus is the one with the Diamond Standard (erc 2535 with faucets) is a modification to ERC 1155. 
    2. Terminus extends EIP-1155 by allowing game designers and game developers to define *transferability*, *burnability*, and even supply limits at the level of token IDs. It also allows game designers and game developers to delegate minting and burning capabilities on individual token IDs to other accounts or to other smart contracts.

8. **Gaming Education - Tailoring early content to your frontier and hardcore gamer**
    1. As your frontier gamers (who have little education around crypto) who experience your game for the first time - the education around Web3 will need to be broken down and made incredibly simple. This may involve a few trials, perhaps they join a gaming guild (a community on the game) where they are shown how the game works but its own community and in turn, are perhaps rewarded a form of token that allows the game to continue the engaging community early on with potentially higher retention.
9. **Community**
    1. The future of consumer apps will be built by builders and communities which will allow stakeholders to own the assets and efficiently allow games to have endless chapters - the games may never end. The community experience will be a really important factor in how gaming platforms engage and make the immersive experience fun and entertaining for the player. Similar to Web3 communities, community members start becoming protective of who is in the community and are they a valuable member. As soon as a flood of players start milking these gaming platforms to make money, it will really affect the success of the game
10. **Regulation and understanding the impact of crypto**
    1. Masking crypto games especially from Apple Appstore and Google Playstore

### Sinks and Faucets - What actions can be done onchain

Sinks and faucets are mechanisms that game designers use to
regulate the distribution of digital assets. In other words, “faucets”
dispense digital assets while “sinks” remove them from circulation.

Below, we outline the most common sink and faucet mechanisms
across both traditional games and web3 games. Understanding
these mechanisms is crucial to potentially identifying strong (or
weak) web3 game economic design.
• Utilities: Typically, these are nominal costs for ongoing in-game
activity such as Runescape’s toll at the Al Kharid gate or the
armor depreciation mechanics in games like Elder Scrolls. Game
developers need to be careful to not rely too heavily on utility sinks
as they can make the game more painful than enjoyable for players.
• Casinos: The introduction of gambling mechanics in games
reached its zenith in the mid to late 2010s. On the one hand, they
serve as extremely effective sinks with statistically guaranteed
negative expected value for players. Developers usually dangle
the rarest in-game items as rewards, stimulating strong demand
from the player-side for these rare items. Examples include
Loot Boxes in Call of Duty (since discontinued in favor of Battle
Passes) and Runescape’s Treasure Hunter. The issue with
introducing in-game casinos is that players hate them and view
these as exploitative measures. Regulators have also been
increasingly hostile towards this mechanism with countries like
Belgium outright banning the practice in 2018.
• Collectibles: One of the simplest and most effective sinks
is selling ultra-rare collectibles, for high amounts of in-game
currencies, directly to the players. Examples include condensed
gold in Runescape, which costs upwards of 10mn GP and can’t
otherwise be made by players. These types of sinks tend to be
the well-received by players as they don’t inherently change the
game’s mechanics and they reward long-time players who have
accumulated enough resources to buy the collectibles in the
first place. It also allows these same high-tier players to signal
social status and hierarchical worth by way of displaying these
expensive, collectible items. In the world of web3, grail NFTs issued
directly by a game would achieve similar goals, and this mechanic
seems like an inevitability for future web3 game developers.
• Taxation: In-game taxation serves as a sink to counterbalance
new digital asset issuance. Traditionally, taxes in games are
levied by game marketplaces, such as RuneScape’s Grand
Exchange, which not only charge a 2% tax on each sale but
then uses the proceeds from these sales to buy back and burn
additional items listed on the marketplace. Taxes are already
leveraged in the web3 gaming space with Axie implementing a
4.25% tax on all marketplace sales and Star Atlas outlining a plan
to implement a land value tax. We expect in-game taxation to be
commonplace across web3 games.
• Consumables: Consumables are high-velocity, low-value,
in-game items that are used by players to create high-value, nontransferable items. RPG games, like Runescape’s construction
skill, are the canonical example of this sink mechanic. Essentially,
players have a strong incentive to signal status with playerbuilt houses, and, most importantly, these houses cannot be
bought or sold. They must be built by the players themselves
with the player’s construction skill. The act of levelling up one’s
construction skill in Runescape requires the player to churn 

through massive quantities of raw materials like planks, nails, and
tools. However, the satisfaction of levelling up this skill coupled
with the creative outlets it provides to players, and the social
clout it grants players, actually makes it a compelling use of one’s
resources. As a result, demand for these consumables manifest
in a very organic manner, helping eliminate massive quantities of
the game’s currency from circulation. In the Runescape example,
planks are the number one item transacted on the platform’s
Grand Exchange. We imagine successful web3 games, particularly
those incorporating virtual land, to employ a similar mechanic
using a mixture of transferable and non-transferable NFTs.
• Donations: Perhaps the most community-friendly of all sinks,
donations are in-game mechanisms where players literally burn
their in-game currency. Runescape famously implemented
this with the Well of Goodwill and awarded players rare titles/
accolades based on the amount donated. The rarest title in
the game, “The Billionaire” was awarded to those players who
donated 5bn GP or more (an extraordinary amount even for elite
players). The social clout that came with this non-transferable title
dwarfed that of party hat holders (the rarest in-game item). This
mechanism is also reminiscent of in-game prestiging popularized
by Call of Duty 4 (and discussed in detail in a later section).
• Staking: Although staking mechanisms have existed in games
before web3, they were popularized by DeFi protocols and are a
core primitive in the web3 gaming space. The purpose of staking
boils down to removing currency and/or NFTs from marketplaces
by incentivizing users to stake their digital assets in exchange
for earnings. Axie Infinity incorporates staking mechanisms for
both its fungible currency and non-fungible land plots. Yuga Labs
also plans to incorporate staking of their $APE coin, the native
fungible currency for their Otherside metaverse game. The key
challenge with staking, as seen with the rise and fall of OHM
forks last year, is preventing new currency issuance used to pay
yield to stakers from devaluing the currency itself. If a gaming
protocol simply relies on massive token inflation to incentivize
staking pools, the sink turns into a faucet.
• Fees from Ancillary Infrastructure: STEPN is the canonical
example of a web3 game levying this model. To swap SOL tokens
for GST tokens, the user is forced to swap via STEPN’s integrated
exchange. STEPN takes a fee on each swap and could theoretically
also use the earned funds to burn excess tokens. By creating a
core piece of infrastructure to power the game, developers can
charge fees in the game’s native currency and create a natural sink.
• Derivative Works (mods): Games like Fortnite and Minecraft
encourage community-driven game mods that build on top of
the base game’s underlying architecture. Web3 seems extremely
well-positioned to fully leverage the power of community mods
for games due to the open-source ideology commonplace in
web3 developer circles. So long as the modded version of the
game requires the same in-game currencies and/or NFTs as the
base game, the modded games will naturally spawn increased
demand for in-game currencies. This organic demand can
theoretically counterbalance new digital asset issuance. The
Sandbox metaverse platform is architected with this strategy 

front-of-mind. Broadly speaking, “meta games,” or games built on
existing infrastructure and/or IP, are well-suited for web3 games
to leverage as currency sinks.
• Garbage Collection: This sink mechanism simply refers to the
phenomenon of a player dropping an item (typically in an RPG
game) and the game itself completely deleting the item from
existence once enough time has elapsed and no other player has
picked the item up. Most players are savvy enough to prevent
valuable items from dropping and disappearing, so this sink has
limited effectiveness compared to other methods.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-09 at 2.16.08 PM.png](Notes%20for%20GamingxAA%20Research%20Q1%202023%2044e4af162ee647fda676a5b7218d811e/Screen_Shot_2023-03-09_at_2.16.08_PM.png)

. We outline some of the interesting game
economic design choices they made below:
• Completely free-to-play: Any time a new player joins, they
are issued 12 or more common cards for free. These cards
are not NFTs and do not live on the blockchain. This strategy
helps increase the TAM of the player base, which is crucial to
onboarding potential whales. It also allows casual gamers or
socializers to test the waters before committing capital.
• Fixed supply of rare NFTs: As the number of new players
increases, the net issuance of in-game digital assets does
not change at all. This ensures that each NFT holds its value
over time, though it does mean that rare NFTs will become
increasingly difficult to obtain as more users join the platform.

No currency distancing: In fact, Sorare doesn’t even have
a fungible token that’s used for its games. Instead, Sorare
supports purchases of NFTs in USD with a credit/debit card.
It appears Sorare is attempting to strike a balance between
ease-of-onboarding and proper game economic design. Until
web3 becomes more mainstream, it is possible that currency
distancing takes a backseat due to the added UI/UX complexity
of incorporating fungible tokens.
• Use of tournaments for NFT utility: We are very bullish on
the use of tournaments to create utility for rare NFTs, which
is the entire premise of Sorare’s fantasy sports NFT game. A
player must work their way up the ladder to unlock higher-level
tournaments that require rarer NFTs to compete. By allowing
players to compete against others for valuable NFTs, Sorare
is coupling NFT utility with a player’s level of engagement and
enthusiasm to play at a high level. These engaged players also
happen to be the most monetizable for the developer. This
mechanic also keeps mercenary players looking to make a quick
buck at bay.
• Partial market control: Players can buy and sell their NFT trading
cards on both Sorare’s marketplace and any Ethereum-based
NFT marketplace like OpenSea. Although Sorare’s marketplace
doesn’t implement any visible sinks in the form of fees, they
have the option to do so at a later point if needed. However, their
conservative approach to asset issuance likely precludes the
need to do so.
• Captivity commodification mechanism: While Sorare is allowing
players to carry their rare NFTs into the ensuing season, the stats
players accumulate for each NFT will reset each season. This
model, popularized by prestiging and battle passes in successful
games over the last decade, helps keep players engaged with
Sorare’s platform at the expense of other potential competitors.
We think other web3 games will find ways to incorporate this
powerful mechanic given its track record of success in AAA titles
such as Call of Duty.
