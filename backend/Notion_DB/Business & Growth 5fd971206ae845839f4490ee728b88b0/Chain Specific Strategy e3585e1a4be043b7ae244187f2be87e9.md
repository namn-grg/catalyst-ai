# Chain Specific Strategy

[Gas costing on various chains](Chain%20Specific%20Strategy%20e3585e1a4be043b7ae244187f2be87e9/Gas%20costing%20on%20various%20chains%20fe678a17f3674b8c9542c79c742d6049.md)

**Have skipped Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism because cost comparison is obvious there**

## Gasless Top Uses Cases

1. Sponsor gas for a specific transaction to incentivise the user to do that transaction, including gasless onboarding/migration (Biconomy will also optimise and minimise the gas spends)
2. End-user does not have the native token and can still use your dApp.
3. Avoid transaction failures at high throughputs and otherwise (have not seen a lot of excitement around this though) or 100% transaction finality
