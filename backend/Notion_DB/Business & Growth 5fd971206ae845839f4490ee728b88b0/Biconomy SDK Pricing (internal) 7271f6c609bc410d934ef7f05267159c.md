# Early Access Pricing

Pricing terms for beta launch integration partners.

### Free to Integrate

The Biconomy SDK is powered by open source technology and is free to integrate. 

View the repo [here](https://github.com/bcnmy/biconomy-client-sdk).  

### Pay for User Operations

Biconomy has been doing gas estimation since 3 years, as a result, we are able to save users ~15% in gas compared to market, using our superior algorithms. So our pricing here is at that layer.

A gas price premium is added to each blockchain operation in the Biconomy SDK.
