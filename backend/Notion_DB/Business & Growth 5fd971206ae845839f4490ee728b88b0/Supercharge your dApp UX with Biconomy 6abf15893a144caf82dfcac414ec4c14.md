# Supercharge your dApp UX with Biconomy

# About

Biconomy is a web3 infrastructure company that helps developers deliver a frictionless user experience to onboard the next billion users. We solve on-chain and cross-chain user experiences by abstracting blockchain complexities for end users.

# Our Product

Over the last couple of years, Web3.0 has seen huge adoption, but mainstream users have yet to come. A wallet is the first touchpoint for anyone who wants to use a dApp, and we feel that the UX for a web3 user is broken at the root level of wallets. We want to redefine this broken onboarding and redefine better wallets for tomorrow. We believe that the days when we'll laugh about the idea of having to rely on a piece of paper to access blockchains are very close, and account abstraction might be the answer.

As proposed by Vitalik Buterin in EIP4337, account abstraction is the process of making all EOA accounts nearly indistinguishable, effectively removing the need for EOAs and special handling for smart contract wallets. We believe that this is the NEXT BIG THING! To support this, we have created an ultimate toolkit for developers to leverage smart contract wallets and simplify user journeys from complex multi-step web3 UX into a simple one-click experience. Our infrastructure is cross-chain compatible out-of-the-box and can, therefore, be implemented across all EVM chains.

ü§ù We operate with a customer-first approach and ensure dedicated and real-time support for all our services. Our plug-n-play SDKs can be integrated at blazing speeds and are powered by a trustless, auto-scalable relayer infrastructure. You can check out our documentation here.

# Why it matters?

Using a Smart Contract to interact with the Web 3.0 ecosystem instead of traditional EOAs allows the dApp developer to offer customized single-click user flows. You can interact with dApps on Polygon or BNB Chain while sitting on Ethereum, that too in one click.

üí° We believe a user comes for the use case but stays for the experience. Making the UX easy and seamless is the way forward to onboard the next billion users.

Super common transactions such as Approve & Swap or Mint & Stake can be batched, made gasless, and can be executed on all EVM chains from any EVM chain. We use a combination of our relayer infrastructure, cross-chain message passing, and Smart Accounts to enable these features.

# The value proposition of our SDK

Biconomy SDK elevates both on-chain and cross-chain experience. Biconomy SDK can help deliver onboarding Web 2.0 users with email and offer credit card-based NFT checkouts off-the-bat, and more can be built on top of the contract as and when you like. Some other use cases are -

### For User Onboarding

1. Social Sign-in - Even Web2.0 users can simply use the dApp with just an email secured by multi-party computation (MPC).
2. Fiat on-ramps and checkouts - Allow your users to buy crypto or NFTs with Wire Transfers or Credit cards.
3. Secured by Social Recovery - Lost your private key? No worries, you can set up a recovery mechanism.
4. RPC Agnostic User flows - Your users won‚Äôt need to switch RPC to use your dapp as long as they're on an EVM RPC.
5. Custom Signature Schemes - Simpler and quantum-resistant digital signatures such as Schnorr and BLS are a clear improvement over the current ECDSA.

### For User Engagement and Retention

1. Transactions and gas payments in non-native tokens - Allow users to pay for transactions and gas in their token or any other ERC20 token.
2. Cross-chain Message and Token transfers - You can execute any contract on Chain B from Chain A without asking the user to change the RPC provider.
3. Gas-less transactions - Improve user onboarding and engagement with a gasless flow.
4. Zero-failed transactions - We take a 100% guarantee of settlement for all transactions flowing through us.
5. DApp Session Keys - You can create a login session for your user, within which the user can use the dApp without signing repeatedly.
6. Transaction Batching - Group common transactions to offer gas-light execution and one-click experiences.
7. Human Readable Signatures - Instead of random hashes, users can see what they are signing.
8. Transaction Automation - You can automate and schedule transactions on the go!
9. Limits and Allowlists - You can apply custom transaction execution limits and whitelist/blacklist addresses at the contract level.
10. Notification Events - Create notifications by listening to on-chain events and user activity.
11. Future Proofing to support Account Abstraction - Our tech is future-proof and is compatible with EIP-4337 and paymaster logic.
