# Gas Grants by Biconomy

We at Biconomy are building to support the onboarding of the next billion users into the Web 3 ecosystem. For this, we want to abstract the complexities of gas fees and allow the end-users to enjoy a fluid and seamless experience, whenever they interact with any dApp.

To hide gas-related obstacles and enable a superior UX, we developed the Gasless product, built on top of our in-house relayer infrastructure. Gasless allows any dApp builder to sponsor the gas fees on the behalf of their end-users and offer them a better experience without the gas popups.

Using meta-transactions, Gasless basically shifts the onus of gas fee payment from the end-user to Biconomy relayers, which we charge back to the dApp builder or owner. This way the end-users enjoy gasless transactions and the dApp builders can bootstrap their traction and customer acquisition.

To help the dApp owners further in their growth and general Web 3.0 adoption, we are proud to launch **Gas Grants by Biconomy** for dApps building on Fantom.
