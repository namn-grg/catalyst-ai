## Projections

Assuming 50K userops daily, (our current gasless scale), we have 1.5M userops per month.

At $0.005, we will make roughly $5000 subtracting some would be free transactions. Other avenues that are not live yet are gas arbitrage in bundlers, MEV and PFOF in userops flow and revenue share from value added services on wallet and paymaster.
