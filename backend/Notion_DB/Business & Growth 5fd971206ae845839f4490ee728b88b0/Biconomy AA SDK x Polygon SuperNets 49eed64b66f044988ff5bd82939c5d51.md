## Tech Stack for Biconomy SDK with Smart Wallets using EIP 4337

---

1. Smart wallets -  Programmable and self-custodial wallets that leverage smart contracts to manage user funds and assets on the blockchain.
2. Bundlers: Nodes that bundle multiple UserOperations to ensure efficient transaction processing and fee-prioritization.
3. EntryPoint Contract: a global singleton contract that serves as the universal entry point for all ERC-4337 compliant smart contract wallets, simplifying wallet logic and ensuring safety in the transaction process.
4. Off-chain Architecture: An alternative UserOps mempool that coexists with the standard mempool, enabling a smooth interaction between bundlers, block-building nodes, and the EntryPoint contract.
5. Paymasters: a system that sponsors transactions for users, enabling use cases such as fee subsidies, ERC-20 token payments, off-chain payment methods, and on-chain credit services.
6. Developer Dashboard: We will offer a developer dashboard that provides granular control over user operations, paymasters, and bundlers, as well as detailed statistics. This will allow developers to have a single view for all aspects of their work.
7. Aggregators: Helper contracts that validate aggregated UserOperation signatures, enhancing efficiency and scalability in transaction processing whilst reducing cost.
