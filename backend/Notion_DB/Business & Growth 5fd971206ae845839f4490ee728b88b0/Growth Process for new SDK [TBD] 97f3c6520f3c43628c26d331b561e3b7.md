# Growth Process for new SDK [TBD]

The goal here is to do whatever is necessary in the short term (uptil Q2 2023) and focus on employing less tactical and more execution heavy mindset and focus on extracting the maximum of a few things.

## Stage 1 - Customer Acquisition & Awareness

Acquisition is the first stage of the funnel. It refers to the process of attracting potential customers to your business.

1. **Referrals -** Referrals can happen from foundation teams of chains, product partners, distribution partners, accelerators and tech shops.

2. **Targeted Outbound -** This is who we target and how do we vet that these are the best customers for us. 2 major target segments-
    1. Finding quality new projects to partner with - [](Client%20Acquisition%20Channels%20e7f5a71b6332421a8b7c3113ca25f854/Untitled%20Database%2054f653237de54b6f86e30280f7a4f23e.md) 
    2. Reaching out to major projects - TBD (Will do once product reaches more maturity)
    
3. **All Marketing Initiatives -** This is not a direct function of growth, the marketing team can run the show as they seem best. 
    1. **“Book a demo”** is the CTA that we want to drive from every and all marketing activities that we do. 
    2. Will make “book a demo” link mandatory to be shared whenever we do any Tweet thread, AMA, Discord Announcement etc etc.
    
4. **Awareness & Research -** To stay on top of the market and competitors. Use Twitter Lists and Zapier Queries to do so async, apart form this conduct active research.

## 2. Activation & Onboarding

Activation is the second stage of the funnel. Once you have acquired potential customers, the next step is to get them to take a specific action, for us, this is to convince them of their need for Biconomy and get them integrated.

1. **Training** - All the folks on the growth team should have end-to-end technical understanding of AA, SCW, and our SDK in general.
    1. Growth Training Calls - Product/feature updates, any changes to the pitch and collaterals are covered here.
    2. Tech Training Calls - The dev team shows us end to end integration lifecycle and answers the questions that we have.

### Pitching

1. Build out Sales Collaterals & keep them updated - *Currently Missing a 1 pager*
2. Understand our Competition and why we’re the best choice

## 3. Retention & Feedback Loops

Retention is the third stage of the funnel. Once a customer has taken the desired action, the focus shifts to retaining their interest and keeping them engaged with your business over time. This can be achieved through regular communication, personalized offers, or loyalty programs.

## 4. Revenue & Monetisation

Revenue is the fourth stage of the funnel. Once you have retained customers, the goal is to convert them into paying customers. This can be achieved through various means such as upselling, cross-selling, or offering premium services or products.

## 5. Referral & Success

Referral is the final stage of the last funnel. Once you have converted customers into paying customers, the goal is to encourage them to refer others to your business. This can be achieved through referral programs, word-of-mouth marketing, or social proof.
