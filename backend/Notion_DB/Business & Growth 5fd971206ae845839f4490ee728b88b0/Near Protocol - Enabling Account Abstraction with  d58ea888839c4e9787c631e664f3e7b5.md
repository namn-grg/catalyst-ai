# Our roadmap with timelines for NEAR Chain

---

Our goal is to simplify the user experience (UX) for Web3.0 dApps by introducing Account Abstraction. This bridges traditional Web2 applications with the blockchain ecosystem. We use EIP-4337 to create a seamless, user-friendly experience that lowers barriers to entry and encourages widespread adoption.

EIP-4337 introduces Smart Wallets, which allow users to interact with the blockchain using familiar operations. This simplifies the user experience. Bundlers and paymasters ensure transactions are processed efficiently and securely, reducing network congestion and enhancing throughput. EIP-4337 Account Abstraction separates the execution of transactions from the management of accounts, providing a standardized interface for third-party developers to integrate with the Ethereum network. It enhances security, scalability, and privacy features, enabling support for new use cases and applications.
