    Hi Frens,
    
    We've launched the powerful and hyper-flexible Biconomy SDK you've been waiting for. Now you can build effortlessly while keeping things simple for end users; integration with the SDK takes only minutes, and allows easy plugging, stacking, and customisation of APIs and modules that result in one-click user journeys, transaction bundling, and control over gas fees.
    
    Would be awesome if you can help spread the love on Twitter and other social channels 🚀🙏🏼 thank you!
