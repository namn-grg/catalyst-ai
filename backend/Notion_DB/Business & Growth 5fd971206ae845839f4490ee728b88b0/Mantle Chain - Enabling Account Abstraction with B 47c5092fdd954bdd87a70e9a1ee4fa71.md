# Our roadmap and Go-live timelines for Mantle Chain

---

Our goal is to revolutionize the UX for Web3.0 dApps by implementing Account Abstraction, which bridges the gap between traditional Web2 applications and the blockchain ecosystem. We use EIP-4337 and EIP-2771 to create a seamless, user-friendly experience that lowers the barriers to entry for new users and encourages widespread adoption.

EIP-4337 introduces Smart Wallets, which allow users to interact with the blockchain using familiar operations. This approach simplifies the user experience by abstracting away the complexities of the blockchain and presenting a streamlined experience similar to traditional web applications. Bundlers and paymasters ensure that transactions are processed efficiently and securely, reducing network congestion and enhancing transaction throughput.

EIP-2771 complements EIP-4337 by enabling gasless transactions through relayers for EOAâ€™s (without using Smart Contract wallets), which facilitate transactions on behalf of users and cover associated gas fees. This approach eliminates the need for users to manage gas fees, making it more accessible for those unfamiliar with blockchain technology. 

Together, these technologies make decentralized applications more user-friendly and promote widespread adoption.

# Product Pricing

---

For using the Biconomy Gasless SDK, our relayers will charge a 12% premium on all transactions. The dApp or developer does not need to pay this fee separately; instead, the premium will be settled from the same pool as the gas costs, which are covered by gas tokens deposited in our gas tank. This will be done on a pay-as-you-go basis, per transaction.

For pricing details on the Account Abstraction SDK, please refer to [this page](Biconomy%20SDK%20Pricing%206f4537a645af4b8985f4d43f2b045865.md).
