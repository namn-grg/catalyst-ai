# Gas Tank FAQ's

**What are the benefits of the gas tank?**

1. You get your very own and private gas tank for your dApp, which ensures that no transaction gets dropped or fails due to insufficient funds.
2. All the native tokens you deposit will solely be used to sponsor gas for your end-users
3. Gas management and analytics features will allow you to control gas spending, set limits, and be on top of gas accounting.

**Who is impacted by the gas tank launch?**

All exciting partners using our gasless meta transactions product are impacted.

**What is the impact on an existing partner?**

Earlier, for all L2 blockchains, Biconomy used to pay gas fees on behalf of our partners. Moving forward, each partner is requested to pre-deposit native token into our gas tank smart contract. This pre-deposit fund will be used to power the gasless transactions.

NOTE - We will not charge any markup on the gas paid. We will only deduct an amount equivalent to what your end-users spend on gas, and this is verifiable on-chain.

**Is there any impact on the dApp end-users?**

No, there is no impact on the end-users. They will continue enjoying a superior UX on your dApp just like before.

**What are the next steps for an existing partner?**

We request you to fill up the gas tank & be rest assured that the relayers will fund the gas for all your user’s transactions. When the gas is low, we will send you a reminder to fill the tank up again so you never run out of gas!

**How much does a partner need to deposit into the gas tank?**

We will send additional emails regarding this very soon. It will include a suggestive number based on the past 4-8 weeks average gas usage for all of your active dApps.

Some partners have previously given a deposit to Biconomy; what about that?

Don't worry; all outstanding gas pre funds are safe and automatically reflect on the dApp gas tank.

**Does one have to do all of this immediately?**

We understand that this could be a big change for our partners, and hence we are giving a grace period to fill up the gas tank before we make it live for everyone. Starting 3 December 2021 till 19 December 2021, you will be able to fill up your gas tank. ****We will make the gas tank module live for our partners on 20 December 2021 at 00:00 UTC.
