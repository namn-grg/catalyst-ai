# Biconomy SDK Pricing

---

At Biconomy, we believe in simplifying the user experience for all decentralized applications (dApps) and making Web3 mainstream. We apply this ethos to design easy-to-understand and fair pricing for our products. This allows you to focus on innovating and creating kick-ass dapp experiences.

Our pricing model is flexible and modular, matching our tools and solutions. We provide a free quota for individual developers and small teams, and we never charge for usage on testnets.

# What are the next steps to signup?

You can quickly and easily sign up for our service on our website by providing your billing and payment details. There are no upfront costs or hidden fees because we operate on a pay-as-you-go basis.

At the end of each month, we'll send you a detailed invoice and charge your card accordingly. We'll soon be launching a self-serve dashboard to make managing your billing and invoicing even more convenient.

# Some frequently asked questions (FAQs)

- **Why the new pricing structure?**
    
    We are committed to offering high-quality products and services. This new pricing is a step in the right direction for us to ensure that we deliver a superior experience, onboarding, and value creation for our partners.
    
- **Will I be charged upfront or is there some minimum subscription?**
    
    You won't be charged upfront, and there are no subscriptions or lock-ins. Our goal is to create value for our users, and we only charge for actual product usage.
    
- **Where can I see all my hosted dApps and their usage statistics?**
    
    You can check out the vital statistics on our developer dashboard [here.](https://dashboard.biconomy.io/sign-in)
    
- **Will you charge us on gas as well -  like a premium or percentage?**
    
    We do not charge any premium on gas. Instead, we have a flat rate for user operations. We recognise that sponsoring gas is already a significant acquisition expense, and we do not want to add to that. :P
    
- **Where can I find my billing information and historical invoices?**
    
    We are working on creating a self serve dashboard for that. Please wait for it.
    
- **When will I be billed?**
    
    You will be billed at the end of every month, regardless of when you signed up. At the end of each month, you will receive an invoice. For example, if you start using our service on April 16th, you will still receive an invoice at the end of April to settle any payments for April.
    
- **What does the price for each user operation include?**
    
    The fee includes the cost of running bundlers and supporting paymasters. However, it **does not** cover gas fees. To pay for gas fees, you must pre-deposit native tokens separately so that the paymaster can pay on your behalf. **You can make a gas deposit in our dashboard, checkout the docs [here.](https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/biconomy-dashboard)**
    
- **How can I offer gasless transactions?**
    
    To enable the paymaster service with our SDK, you need to deposit native gas tokens for the chain on which you wish to sponsor user transactions. Please note that we only support native token deposits and do not accept fiat or stable coins for covering gas fees. For example, if your dapp is on Polygon and is expected to spend 100 Matic in gas fees, you should deposit 100 Matic tokens into the gas. You can checkout the docs [here.](https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/biconomy-dashboard#setting-up-a-gas-tank)
    
- **What are monthly active wallets (MAWs) for social logins?**
    
    1 Monthly Active Wallet (MAW) = 5 logins per unique wallet per month
    
    Formula is Total logins divided by 5 = Â Total MAWs
    
    For example, If a unique wallet does 17 logins, this is counted as 4 MAWs (17/5=4 ~ round up to whole number).
