### If the dApp has shown prior interest in Hyphen (Product field has Hyphen)

Hey everyone,

As you might know, we recently launched Hyphen 2.0, further improving the fastest cross chain bridge. Since you’ve shown interest in Hyphen in the past, we wanted you to know that we will be live on BSC in a week. With our new Hyphen widget, you can have an in-dApp bridge in a matter of minutes!

Here’s how you can benefit from sourcing multichain liquidity & users for your dApp: [https://bit.ly/biconomy-hyphen](https://bit.ly/biconomy-hyphen) 
We currently support ETH & Stablecoins; let us know if you need another Token supported on Hyphen
